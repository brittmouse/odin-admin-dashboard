# Odin Admin Dashboard
This is the repo for my most recent TOP Project: the Admin Dashboard.

I consider this finished, although there are certainly things that don't
quite work. For starter's, the way I have the grid view laid out is such
that it only works well when viewing on a maximized browser screen on
a laptop. Resizing tends to break it, as the cards will "hang" off the
bottom of the grid. A good chunk of the text is all "lorem ipsum." I also
wish I knew how to recolor the SVGs to match with the colorscheme but some
web searching left me more confused than informed.

The font is [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand). The
colorscheme used here is [Catppuccin
Latte](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin). Most SVGs are pulled
from [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/). The
remaining (colorful) ones are copied over from the Papirus icon theme to
just fill some stuff in.
